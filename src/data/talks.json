      "​For twenty years JavaScript's dynamic typing has given us an easy-to-use scripting language. But now Flow and TypeScript are changing the foundations of the language. Far from turning our code into an object oriented mess, static typing gives us JavaScript code that's cleaner, simpler and more predictable.",

      "​Many companies say they want the best developers. But they don’t back that up with their actions. Facebook has invested heavily in designing a culture that grows developers over many years. In this session, Josh, now back in Australia managing a team at the ABC, shares lessons he learned working for Facebook, a company renowned for their engineering prowess, producing such widely used open source technologies as React and GraphQL despite growing its engineering head count at an almost unimaginable rate over the last decade.",

      "React makes it easy to build beautiful and responsive JavaScript applications. But moving rendering from server to client reveals new and unique performance challenges. Preloading data, minimizing round trips, and reducing JS overhead are some of the problems JavaScript developers face. Server and client execution are fundamentally different; each has distinct strengths and weaknesses. Building fast applications means designing systems that combine the strengths of both of these environments. We'll look at how Facebook is doing this with abstractions like GraphQL and Relay, the specific problems that each library solves, and how we can apply the same design principles to other performance problems.
